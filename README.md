# RentalApp -Flutter UI/UX
RentalApp is a Flutter-based mobile application showcasing a  and visually appealing UI for exploring rental properties.
## Features
Carousel Sliders:
Multiple carousel sliders are used to display locations and recommended properties.
Dynamic content loaded through lists and maps.
# property details
Display property details like rate per night, available rooms, ratings, and additional info.
Modern UI with rounded corners, cards, and interactive elements.
# Responsiveness
Adaptive UI design for different mobile screen sizes 
# challenge overcome
Responsive Layout: I used MediaQuery to make the layout responsive across different screen sizes.For example, I adjusted the header section's height based on the screen height.

Dynamic Property Displays: To manage and display multiple properties dynamically, I used ListView.builder(to scroll vertically) and CarouselSlider(to scroll horizontally) to create interactive and flexible carousels for location and recommended properties.
